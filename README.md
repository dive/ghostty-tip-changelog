### Changes

- [`c4e1697`](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/commit/c4e16970a803b170e352432424f44192cb59f3ac) renderer: release GPU resources for hidden surfaces (macOS) ([@mitchellh](https://github.com/mitchellh))
  ```text
  Ref #12034
  
  This commit releases many GPU resources when a surface becomes invisible and
  rebuilds it on the next draw. I don't say "all" because there are still
  some things we can improve on (Kitty images).
  
  We previously held onto all GPU resources for the lifetime of the surface
  regardless of its visibility state. This is 3x (for triple-buffering):
  screen render targets, uniform/cell/custom shader buffers, font textures,
  and more.
  
  Measured on macOS (Metal):
  
  | Measurement (1 visible + 20 hidden tabs)    | Before    | After   |
  |---------------------------------------------|-----------|---------|
  | Tracked GPU allocations (steady state)      | 384.6 MiB | 18.3 MiB |
  | `MTLDevice.currentAllocatedSize`            | 393.3 MiB | 19.7 MiB |
  | `footprint` IOSurface (dirty)               | 309 MB    | 15 MB   |
  | Swap chain rebuild on unhide (42 switches)  | n/a       | avg 0.43 ms, max 0.55 ms |
  
  As you can see, importantly, swap chain rebuild is fast: 0.43ms average.
  That means that the rebuild is imperceptible and happens well within
  a frame draw time.
  
  This is macOS only, but most of the work was in the generic renderer.
  GTK only needs to call `releaseGpuResources` when it becomes invisible
  to get the same benefits. I didn't have my VM handy to test this yet so
  I didn't include it.

  ```text
  The Kitty clipboard protocol now specifies base64 handling:
  All OSC 5522 payloads and the base64 metadata values (mime, name, pw)
  use strict RFC 4648 with the standard alphabet. Characters outside
  the alphabet (including whitespace) and incorrect padding must be
  rejected, never silently skipped.
  
  For wdata payloads for one MIME type, the base64 stream can be split
  at arbitrary packet boundaries and only the concatenation must be
  correctly padded.
  
  Simdutf has a strict mode for base64 so we got this for free.

  ```text
  Refs #11216
  
  The dcs_passthrough state only forwarded bytes 0x00-0x7E to the DCS
  handler. Bytes 0x80-0x9F hit the "anywhere" C1 transitions and exited
  the string, while 0xA0-0xFF fell through to the default transition and
  were silently dropped. **This breaks any DCS payload carrying UTF-8. **
  
  A continuation byte in the C1 range terminates or corrupts the string:
  "Ü" is 0xC3 0x9C, so the 0xC3 is dropped and the 0x9C acts as 8-bit ST,
  ending the DCS mid-character.
  
  Also, a payload byte such as 0x9B (second byte of "Û") transitions to
  csi_entry, so the remainder of the payload executes as a live control sequence.
  This is a prerequisite for tmux control mode (#1935), whose %output
  notifications carry raw UTF-8 pane content.
  
  Fix this in the parse table only: override 0x80-0xFF in
  dcs_passthrough to put and in dcs_ignore to ignore, exactly how
  osc_string already claims 0x20-0xFF (including 0x9C) as data. This
  deviates from the vt100.net state machine
  (https://vt100.net/emu/dec_ansi_parser) deliberately and includes
  0x9C: a raw 0x9C is indistinguishable from a UTF-8 continuation byte,
  and we don't honor 8-bit C1 controls in the ground state either.

  ````text
  The demo code shown in the `+list-themes` theme preview was stale from
  before the Zig 0.16 migration (context: #12228). It referenced
  `std.Io.getStdOut().writer()`, which never existed in any Zig release,
  and `pub fn main() !void`. This rewrites the rendered sample to valid
  Zig 0.16 idioms:
  
  ```zig
  const std = @import("std");
  
  pub fn main(init: std.process.Init) !void {
      var buf: [1024]u8 = undefined;
      var stdout = std.Io.File.stdout().writer(init.io, &buf);
      const w = &stdout.interface;
  
      var i: usize = 1;
      while (i <= 16) : (i += 1) {
          if (i % 15 == 0) {
              try w.writeAll("ZiggZagg\n");
          } else if (i % 3 == 0) {
              try w.writeAll("Zigg\n");
          } else if (i % 5 == 0) {
              try w.writeAll("Zagg\n");
          } else {
              try w.print("{d}\n", .{i});
          }
      }
      try w.flush();
  }
  ```
  
  The gutter line numbers, row offsets, and child window height were
  renumbered to match, and the zig version shown in the demo prompt line
  was updated from v0.13.0 to v0.16.0.

  ```text
  We now have large OSCs (e.g. Kitty clipboard protocol) on the order
  of megabytes. OSC was still byte-at-a-time. This adds a vector-optimized
  plus bulk storing path to OSC, similar to APC.

  ```text
  Fixes #13940
  
  Various operations like scroll, line insert, erase, etc. operations
  would clear cells but remain row metadata such as wrap flags and
  semantic prompt state.
  
  When we had fast paths in `grow` and other places like resize
  we would adopt that without knowing it because we didn't properly clear.
  
  Fix this by properly clearing row metadata too at the points where we
  erase a row that might be reused.
  
  Benchmarked with terminal-stream workloads for each affected path.
  The added cost is 2-4 instructions per recycled row next to the existing
  full-row cell clear. There was no measurable wall-clock change on any
  workload.
  
  AI helped run the benchmarks for me and analyze for missing places (it found
  some!) but otherwise this was hand-designed.

  ```text
  Update OSC 5522 writes to reject every transaction that exceeds the
  configured decoded-data limit. The previous behavior truncated text
  while rejecting only non-text data.
  
  Programs now receive EFBIG as soon as a write crosses the limit. The
  clipboard remains untouched, and remaining write packets are ignored
  until a new transaction begins. Raise the default to the protocol
  minimum of 64 MiB.

  ```text
  Discussion #13979
  
  Dropped paths and text once again honor bracketed paste mode.
  IME, dictation, emoji picker, and character viewer commits remain typed input.
  
  sendText calls ghostty_surface_text, which applies the clipboard paste
  pipeline and bracketed paste framing when enabled. Separating the
  paths at the drag-and-drop caller preserves the input-method behavior
  introduced by #13817.

- [`1334cc2`](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/commit/1334cc213e6db4be3f2fc695a06c13d49362a570) macos: answer ENOSYS for Kitty clipboard writes to primary ([@mitchellh](https://github.com/mitchellh))
  ```text
  A Kitty clipboard protocol (OSC 5522) write transaction targeting
  `loc=primary` replied `type=write:status=DONE` in the macOS app even
  though macOS has no primary selection and the data was silently
  discarded.
  
  The spec requires ENOSYS when the requested location is not
  available on the system, which the read path already answers correctly:

  ```text
  A Kitty clipboard protocol (OSC 5522) read that only requests the
  targets type ('.') is now served without a permission prompt and never
  consults (or consumes) session password grants.
  
  The spec requires this so that a client listing the available data types
  before reading one doesn't present the user with a double permission prompt.

  ```text
  Add a new `clipboard-write-limit-bytes` option (similar to
  `scrollback-limit-bytes`) to limit the maximum OSC 5522 write size.
  Defaults to 32 MB.
  
  This also adds a new `GHOSTTY_TERMINAL_OPT_CLIPBOARD_WRITE_MAX_BYTES`
  option for libghostty-vt embedders to control the same.
  
  Kitty has a limit too and it works by truncating all data. I decided on
  purpose to diverge from this because I don't think truncated binary data
  is useful. Instead, we reject it so the application knows the write
  didn't work.
  
  We truncate text data, and we try to do it at the nearest complete UTF-8
  sequence (if possible).

  For the future: Kitty spools any write data more than some size (can't
  remember) to a temp file on disk. We might want to consider doing
  something similar since we're all in-memory at the moment. This PR
  doesn't change that.

- [`9313d58`](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/commit/9313d580c6b0aff578160c79fc99fff341cf4aa3) terminal: fix stale cursor style/hyperlink state after scroll clear ([@mitchellh](https://github.com/mitchellh))
  ```text
  Clearing the screen into scrollback and then printing could crash debug
  builds with a page integrity violation, or silently corrupt style/hyperlink
  reference counts in release builds. Found in #13991 via fuzzing.
  
  The cursor's style and hyperlink IDs are only valid on the page the
  cursor is on. When the scroll clear moved the start of the fresh
  screen onto a new page, the reset path in cursorReload updated the
  cursor's position directly instead of going through cursorChangePin,
  so the cursor kept IDs from its old page. On the new page those IDs
  pointed at entries that were dead or belonged to something else, and
  the next print used them.
  
  Fix this by making the reset path go through `cursorChangePin` like
  every other cross-page cursor move, which releases the style and
  hyperlink from the old page and recreates them on the new one.

  ```text
  Programs can now write the system clipboard through the Kitty
  clipboard protocol in the macOS app. This also does all the hard work
  plumbing through core termio/apprt so GTK should be an easy follow.
  
  This functionality lets clients copy arbitrary representations (images,
  HTML, etc.) into the clipboard. Writes honor `clipboard-write`: allow
  applies silently, deny answers EPERM up front before any data is used,
  and ask shows the standard confirmation prompt.

  After this, I believe the core and macOS have 100% Kitty clipboard
  implementation but I'll double check after this.

  ````text
  Profiling `mpv --vo=kitty --vo-kitty-use-shm <video>` shows up a copy
  and then swizzle in `prepImage`
  This comes from the renderer copying the raw image data for ownership,
  then doing an rgb to rgba conversion to replace the copied data.
  This change optimize this case by letting the format conversion read
  from the data source instead of a copy of it.

  The existing data path for kitty images is:
  ```
  
  Read tty for Kitty image transmission (srgb, srgba, or PNG bytes)
  -> copy into Kitty graphics ImageStorage (cpu-owned)
  
  Renderer updateFrame creates Image.Pending in renderer-owned CPU storage
  -> sync Kitty ImageStorage with renderer-owned ImageMap
  -> copy bytes into renderer.ImageMap (renderer-owned)
  -> convert ImageMap bytes to preferred GPU upload format
  
  Renderer drawFrame uploads image data to the GPU
  -> iterate through renderer.ImageMap
    -> for Pending image uploads
      -> convert the pixel format (no-op if already done), create the GPU-side texture and upload the data
  ```
  
  # Note
  Kitty graphics only supports RGB and RGBA data
  The image file decode path uses a wuffs png and jpeg decode function
  configured to return RGBA 8-bit, so I think in practice we only ever
  upload RGB8 or RGBA8. And the gray-alpha and gray pixel formats aren't
  ever used.

  I didn't use any LLM assistance for this.

  ```text
  This adds Kitty clipboard protocol _read_ support to macOS. In the
  process, this also does most of the core termio, apprt, and Surface work
  so GTK is likely very easy to do, I just didn't have the machine on hand
  to test at the given moment. I will create an issue to follow up with
  that.
  
  This fully supports:
  
  - Non-text data, like images! For this, we show an image preview.
  - Per-program "remember"
  - Showing the program name if given instead of generic "An application"

  ```text
  **Note: this has no changes for Ghostty GUI yet.** This only impacts
  libghostty-vt.
  
  This introduces a new `ghostty_terminal_paste` C API along with a
  central `terminal.paste.paste` function that handles (1) mode 5522
  (Kitty clipboard) (2) bracketed paste (3) normal paste all in one place,
  combined with unsafe value detection and proper xterm-style newline
  handling.
  
  Terminal pasting is now stateful because for the Kitty clipboard
  protocol in particular, it must mint "grants" that stay with the
  terminal. Previously, paste encoding was stateless.
  
  To start, this is only exposed/used by libghostty to enable Kitty
  clipboard handling.
  
  Other changes:
  
  - **IO: randomSecure.** This also adds the `io.randomSecure`
  implementation to `TinyIo` and a global sys override for it because
  Kitty clipboard requires the ability to create one-time passwords and
  the implementation (following Kitty) requires a crypto random source.
  The sys model is for libghostty embedders.
  
  - **New C result value: rejected.** This introduces a new C result enum
  value "rejected" for values that are valid but rejected for some reason.
  Its very possible that prior "invalid value" users will have to update
  to this, and I recognize that its close to both but it fills an
  important semantic difference.
  
  Also note this still _eagerly_ requires all clipboard contents. I want
  to move to a callback based model but it made the PR much more
  complicated. I plan on playing with that before converting apprt's to
  this.

  ```text
  This builds out the core logic and state machine for the Kitty drag and
  drop protocol for _drops only_. This hooks it into libghostty-vt's Zig
  API but it isn't available to the C API and it isn't hooked up to any
  Ghostty GUI. It isn't really recommended that Zig consumers integrate
  this yet because I'm sure the API will continue to change dramatically
  as I address the missing features: drag source, remote drops, etc.
  
  The major thing this does it the core `src/terminal/kitty/dnd.zig` stuff
  with e2e tests extracted from Kitty's own `kitty_tets/dnd.py`. So this
  verifies that what we have so far is working properly.

  ```text
  This implements only the clipboard _write_ side of the Kitty clipboard
  protocol for libghostty-vt. libghostty users don't need to do anything,
  this all automatically works since it just piggy-backs on the previous
  clipboard write effect.
  
  Clipboard reading is far more complicated because we don't have anything
  designed yet for libghostty-vt that does async requests (e.g. to ask the
  user for permission). I need to think about that more.

  ````text
  Hi, I noticed that this XKB config line was causing problems for
  Ghosttty:
  
  ```
      key <DELE> {   [ ISO_Level3_Shift ] };
  ```
  
  That's a valid reconfiguration of the "delete key" as a modifier, and
  the same worked find in other terminal emulators (like Alacritty). With
  Ghosttty, I was getting actual `<delete>` behaviour whenever I pressed
  the modifier key (although the modifier engaged after that).
  
  This patch fixes it. In line with your AI disclose policy: I made the
  patch with Codex Sol. The logical fix is very succinct, and the bulk of
  the patch works around an underlying issue to do with GDK not
  recognising some modifiers as modifiers. I've tested the implementation
  and the patch definitely resolves it!

  ```text
  This adds a `clipboard_read` effect to the stream terminal handler and a
  matching `GHOSTTY_TERMINAL_OPT_CLIPBOARD_READ` callback to the
  libghostty-vt C API so that embedders can answer OSC 52 read requests
  (the `?` payload).
  
  This is a _blocking_ effect: if the embedder needs to ask the user for
  permission, the entire VT processing pipeline is _blocked_ during the
  callback. This is a purposeful simplification choice compared to how
  Ghostty GUI works with async requests. I think its reasonable, it
  eliminates a TON of complexity.
  
  If the effect isn't set, then any clipboard reads are denied.
  
  This can be expanded easily to support Kitty clipboard protocol later.

  ```text
  Terminal.print's grapheme path holds a raw pointer to the previous cell
  while it writes other cells. Writing the wide spacer tail can grow the
  page to fit the cursor hyperlink, and growing replaces the page, so the
  pointer is left dangling and the following appendGrapheme writes into
  freed memory.
  
  Record the cursor page identity (node pointer plus serial, since pooled
  nodes can reuse an address) before the spacer write and reload the cell
  only when the page actually changed, so the common path costs nothing.
  
  The same function had three more pointers held across an operation that
  can replace a page: the grapheme move after a wrap, the grapheme append
  loop, and printCell's assert on a failed hyperlink write. Those now read
  through the cursor or a freshly resolved pin.

  ```text
  Fixes #11261.
  
  `Terminal.print`'s grapheme path caches a `*Cell` for the previous cell
  and keeps using it after writing other cells. Writing the wide spacer
  tail calls `printCell`, which can grow the page to make room for the
  cursor hyperlink. Growing clones the page and frees the old one, so the
  cached pointer dangles and the following `appendGrapheme` writes into
  freed memory. The second test case in the issue reproduces it.
  
  Rather than recomputing `prev` on every use, which is too expensive for
  this path, the fix records the cursor page identity before the spacer
  write and reloads the cell only if the page actually changed. Node
  pointer plus serial is used because nodes are pooled and a replacement
  can land on the same address. Nothing changes when the page does not
  grow.
  
  Three other pointers in the same function were held across an operation
  that can replace a page, so they are now read through the cursor or a
  freshly resolved pin: the grapheme move after a wrap, the grapheme
  append loop, and `printCell`'s assert on a failed hyperlink write.
  
  Tests:
  
  - `Terminal: VS16 widening when the spacer tail grows the page` fills
  the page hyperlink map so the spacer tail is what forces growth. It
  crashes without the fix.
  - `Terminal: grapheme transfer when widening wraps to the next line`
  covers the wrap path where the previous cell already holds grapheme
  data, which had no test before.
  
  `zig build test` passes.

  ```text
  This adds all the core logic and tests for the full Kitty Clipboard
  protocol in the `src/terminal` package.
  
  This is purposefully shaped similarly to the way we organize Kitty
  graphics. There is an umbrella `clipboard.zig` and then a bunch of leaf
  zig files that cover: request parsing, response encoding, state
  management, etc. I think that worked really well for Kitty graphics so
  we're doing it here too.
  
  The core logic covers every part of the protocol: read and write.
  
  The only thing hooked up to the end user is a DECRQM for mode 5522 will
  return unset. And it can't be set currently (since it never works yet).
  Outside of that, nothing in this diff is actually used in the real
  binary.
  
  **AI usage:** Validation against the spec and Kitty impl, test writing
  and coverage validation, of course some code writing but within the
  broad organizational shape I defined. I went through and either rewrote
  or wrote all the comments myself plus this PR message.

  ```text
  Fixes #5255
  
  This adds support for the Kitty graphics animation frames
  (https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/graphics-protocol/#animation),
  completely (transmission, control, composition, rendering, etc.).
  
  This does it in a somewhat naive way: we pre-compose all frames and
  store the full RGBA in-memory. Animation is already rare enough, and I
  wanted to focus on things working first, so I didn't optimize this very
  well. I also wanted this PR to be relatively understandable up front. We
  can add complexity later.
  
  But, this adds very little overhead to a non-animation using Kitty
  graphics user. The animation state is heap-allocated only when its
  needed. So, it just costs a pointer sized field on every image. Plus a
  little bit of overhead in the loading state (which itself is heap
  allocated during image load only).
  
  On the renderer side, this **unifies Kitty graphics animations and
  custom shader animations into a single animation abstraction.** This
  simplified our renderer thread and made the generic renderer more
  complicated (slightly, its not much!).
  
  **AI usage:** Test writing, validation against the spec/reference
  implementation. I drove the main architecture and shaped out the
  functions and params, animation storage, etc. I had AI fill in some of
  the blanks that I spaced out. Commit messages, comments, and this PR
  message are written by me.

  ```text
  This adds full support for relative placements:
  https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/graphics-protocol/#relative-placements
  (`R=` and `Q=`). The high-level description is that this allows images
  to be placed relative to other images. For more details, the spec
  explains it better than I can, or the demo video below.
  
  The implementation here was pretty straightforward. It mainly revolved
  around adding parent resolution logic to puts (and validation), and
  proper unparented placement reaping in the right points, and then the
  various tests around that. The renderer logic itself was also
  straigthforward, I had to add some offset resolution to the core
  graphics storage but we can reuse that. The main complexity -- as always
  -- (MY OWN EMDASHES) is Unicode placeholders. But... also not too hard.
  
  After this, the only feature we don't support from the protocol is
  animation.
  
  **AI usage:** Test writing, validation against spec/reference, judging,
  and some "fill in the function/block". I setup the overall shape of the
  implementation.

  ```text
  Fixes #4323
  
  The Kitty graphics protocol requires that when margins are defined
  and index commands are used, only images entirely within the scroll
  region are scrolled, and that they are clipped when scrolling would
  cause them to extend outside the region [1].
  
  This implements that part of the spec.
  
  Benchmarked pure `\n` terminal streams to ensure that the no-image case
  is not regressed. Our branch hints plus checks on placements keep that
  true. When images are present, things get a lot slower but thats
  acceptable for now.

  ```text
  Fixes #2197
  
  Image transmissions without an explicit ID (i=) were assigned IDs from
  a wrapping counter starting with no collision check. The protocol allows

  collide.
  
  Number-based transmissions (I= without i=) now receive the smallest ID

  performance issues here require a pathological client and this implementation

  ```text
  Fills the 181 untranslated strings in `po/nl.po`, bringing it to
  252/252. Most of them are the command palette actions from
  `src/input/command.zig`; the rest are the new context menu items, global
  keybind notifications, and config editing strings.
  
  **Style.** Ten of the new command palette strings had already been
  translated by previous translators, and those settle the verb form, so
  the rest follows them: imperative for verb+object action titles (`Split
  Left` → `Splits naar links`, `Close Tab` → `Sluit tabblad`), noun
  phrases left as noun phrases (`New Window` → `Nieuw venster`), no title
  case, informal "je". Descriptions are full imperative sentences. Dialog
  headings keep the noun-first infinitive form of the existing `Change
  Terminal Title` → `Titel van de terminal wijzigen`.
  
  A few translation notes:
  
  - `ANSI Sequences` → `ANSI-reeksen` in titles, `ANSI escape sequences` →
  `ANSI-escapereeksen` in descriptions, mirroring the distinction the
  source makes.
  - `Toggle X` titles use the idiomatic `X aan/uit`; their descriptions
  stay imperative (`Schakel … in of uit.`).
  - `surface` is rendered as `terminal` - the Dutch UI has no equivalent
  concept.
  - `scrollback` → `scrollbuffer`.
  
  **No existing translation was modified.** The diff only touches empty
  `msgstr` lines plus `PO-Revision-Date` and `Last-Translator`.
  
  Checked with `msgfmt -c --statistics` (252 translated, no warnings, no
  fuzzy) and `msgcat` (formatting is idempotent, so no rewrap noise for
  the next translator). No `X-Generator` field added.

  As discussed in Discord: Ghostty internal support for iOS is not
  important and we verify iOS compatibility for `libghostty-vt` through
  compilation.
  
  Diff is **BIG**, but it contains mostly cleanup and didn't touch macOS's
  implementation (except for some renaming).

  ```text
  This adds new functions to both C and Zig to write VT data until the
  VT parser reaches a "ground" state. The ground state is when the
  parser/stream is stateless: between all partial UTF-8, OSC, CSI, etc.
  
  This lets embedders safely interleave custom VT sequences from multiple

  ```text
  ## Summary
  
  - Add `GHOSTTY_TERMINAL_DATA_CURSOR_AT_PROMPT` to expose semantic prompt
  state through `libghostty-vt`.
  - Reuse `Terminal.cursorIsAtPrompt()` rather than introducing separate
  prompt tracking.
  
  ## Motivation
  
  Ghostty already tracks whether the cursor is at a semantic prompt
  through `Terminal.cursorIsAtPrompt()`. Exposing this query through
  `libghostty-vt` lets downstream terminal consumers use Ghostty's
  existing semantic prompt state without introducing separate tracking.
  
  The query returns false when semantic prompt information is unavailable
  or the alternate screen is active.
  
  Discussed in https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/discussions/13755.
  
  ## Testing
  
  - `zig build test-lib-vt`
  - `zig build test-lib-vt -Dtest-filter="get cursor_at_prompt"`
  - `zig build -Demit-lib-vt`
  
  ## AI disclosure
  
  Codex assisted with adding the `libghostty-vt` query and test,
  addressing review feedback, running validation, and drafting this
  description. I reviewed and edited the final code and description,
  reviewed the validation results, and understand how the change interacts
  with Ghostty's semantic prompt state.

  ```text
  ## Summary
  Fix `+new-window -e <command>` inheriting forced shell integration from
  the running GTK application.
  
  Arguments after `-e` are now marked as an explicit command that requires
  shell detection. That marker is propagated with the existing command
  override to the new surface for both the current `+new-window` and
  `+new-tab` GTK paths. When the override is applied, forced shell
  integration becomes `detect`; an explicit `none` remains disabled.
  
  This is scoped to the GTK `-e` path. It does not change the generic
  forced shell-integration behavior, so configured integration continues
  to support shell executables with non-standard names.
  
  Fixes #12378.
  
  ## Root cause
  
  The GTK IPC path replaced `config.command` for the new surface but
  retained the running application's `shell-integration` value. `termio`
  therefore treated an arbitrary explicit command such as Vim as the
  forced shell and appended shell-specific arguments.
  
  ## AI usage
  
  I used Hermes Agent (with ChatGPT 5.6) to help inspect the codebase,
  trace the GTK command path, and draft parts of the implementation and
  test. I manually reviewed and edited the changes, validated the behavior
  and test results, and understand the affected code paths.

  Cell contents used our ArrayListCollection container to manage per-row

  We now own the row list slice directly, initialize cursor capacity to

  ```text
  Previously, insertText commits without marked text were delivered via
  sendText, which applies paste semantics and wraps the text in bracketed
  paste when the program enables it. macOS dictation and other input
  methods often commit without marked text, so programs treated dictated
  text as a paste and applied paste-specific handling.
  
  insertText is only invoked by input methods (IME, dictation, emoji
  picker, character viewer); real paste operations use a separate path.
  Send every non-empty commit through the key event path so programs
  interpret input method text as typed input. Typing is unaffected (the
  accumulator path returns earlier) and Cmd+V pastes are unaffected.
  
  The helper is renamed from committedPreeditTextAction to
  committedTextAction since it no longer only handles preedit commits.

- [`e305665`](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/commit/e3056658d05bdd54db9fd37a02c196bfe81cfe39) libghostty: faster render state updates and C API reads ([@mitchellh](https://github.com/mitchellh))
  ```text
  This improves the performance of render state plus C API reads. I
  specifically benchmarked the C API call and found a lot of overhead in
  the C API layer which this cleans up. The impact of these changes will be
  less visible to Zig consumers but moderately improve there.
  
  All benchmark numbers below are via the C API.
  
  Highlights:
  
  - full rebuilds are **1.71x faster (11.4µs to 6.6µs per 120x80 frame)**
  - single-dirty-row updates (e.g. the TUI/prompt steady state) are *1.44x
    faster**
  - full-frame reads through the C API are **1.2x to 1.8x faster**
  
  ## Changes
  
  * endUpdate skips unchanged style runs.
  * `GRAPHEMES_UTF8` getter gets a fast path for single ASCII codepoints (the
    overwhelming majority of cells).
  * The bg/fg color getters no longer copy the full 28-byte style. Instead,
     they switch directly on the one color field they need.
  * The `get_multi` variants validate the handle and position once per batch
    instead of per key.
  * Iterator positions are sentinel values instead of Zig optionals. The
    optional tagging overhead was showing up in benchmarks.
  * `colors_get` reads through a pointer instead of copying the ~1KB colors
    struct to the stack per call.
  * The palette conversion is vectorized. The 4-byte padded RGB to 3-byte
    was not being auto-vectorized. Explicitly vectorize it. Something like
    a 4x speedup on NEON.
  
  ## Benchmarks
  
  | Benchmark | Before | After | Speedup |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | update (forced full rebuild) | 11.4 µs/frame | 6.6 µs/frame | 1.71x |
  | update (single dirty row) | 143 ns | 99 ns | 1.44x |
  | read cell style/bg/fg/selected | 10.3 ns/cell | 8.8 ns/cell | 1.17x |

  | colors_get + palette | 213 ns/call | 45 ns/call | 4.58x |
  
  Clean updates (no terminal changes) and the raw cell read paths
  are unchanged.

  all human-language (comments) since Fable in particular does really bad

  ```text
  The "Reset" menu item and the "Reset Terminal" command palette entry
  were translated as "Reiniciar", which reads as restarting the terminal

  terminal state without restarting the shell, so "Redefinir" conveys
  the correct meaning and matches the standard pt_BR terminology used

  * style: on wasm, `Style.eql` compares canonical `PackedStyle` forms

  too w/ no regressions (two of the changes are native wins as well).
  
  ## Changes
  
  * color: the "vectorized" palette conversion loop was silently
    scalarized by LLVM into per-byte ops because it loaded/stored through
    array-typed pointers. Zig 0.16 disables the LLVM loop vectorizer, so
    manually vectorized loops must go through vector-typed pointers.
  * C styles: major optimizations to converting Zig styles to C styles.
    This is a heavy operation for render state.
  * render: `endUpdate`'s style-run fill (`@memset` with a struct value)
    re-loaded its source every iteration and stored field by field. Now
    manually vectorized.
  * render: new `GHOSTTY_RENDER_STATE_ROW_DATA_CELLS_RAW` returns a
    borrowed `GhosttyCellsView` of the current row's raw cell values, valid
    until the next update. One call per row instead of 3-6 calls per cell.

  ```text
  This makes the `ghostty_render_state_*` C API significantly faster on
  wasm32-freestanding, measured in V8 via Node for Chrome. Also verified
  in `jsc` for Safari.
  
  The major change is a new bulk row read API that makes full-screen cell
  reads roughly 10x faster for wasm embedders. This should help any
  embedder with high FFI overhead, such as Go, Python, etc. too.

  ```text
  Processing grapheme-heavy input (ZWJ sequences, emoji modifiers, flags,
  combining marks) through is now almost 3x faster.
  
  ### Primary Change: PageList Capacity Projection
  
  This workload was heavily bound by `PageList.increaseCapacity` because
  pathological cases of single-dimensional growth cause repeated page
  capacity doublings which get increasingly expensive because each time we
  do a full allocation + clone.
  
  So the major change is that for grapheme bytes in particular, when we
  reach a capacity limit, we take the current usage for the current set of
  rows and project it out to the remaining capacity of rows. Basically, we
  assume that a similar workload will continue. So rather than doubling,
  we're _guessing_ how much you're going to need.
  
  In the real world, I'm not really sure if this matters at all. There are
  no regressions on any regular corpus streams (asciinema, wikipedia dumps, etc.).
  
  ### Other Changes
  
  There are some other changes here, all found on the path to improving
  grapheme IO throughput:
  
  * The bitmap allocator now maintains `search_start` hint we update on
    every allocation so that future free-scans are much faster. This is
    the lowest possible place we don't have a full bitmap.
  
  * For wasm32, we use an alternate hashing structure for small keys
    since Wyhash's 64bit * 64bit multiplication is very very slow because
    wasm has no widening instruction.
  
  * Terminal `printSlice` now checks the fast path compatibility once up front
    rather than on every fast-path attempt.
  
  ### Benchmarks
  
  Data: ZWJ family/profession sequences, skin-tone modifiers,
  flags, and combining marks streamed in 64 KiB chunks into an 80x24
  terminal, default modes.
  
  | Benchmark | Before | After | Speedup |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | wasm, V8, 16 MiB stream | 52 MB/s | 151 MB/s | 2.9x |
  | native, terminal-stream, 64 MiB | 894 ms | 305 ms | 2.9x |
  
  Sorry the native stuff is in ms, that's how our native `ghostty-bench`
  does things versus the custom little V8 harness.
  
  **AI usage:** Developed alongside Fable: profiling, implementation, and
  benchmarks. All human language messages written myself. Validated myself.

  ```text
  This should release our ReleaseFast bundle from 1.1MB to ~800KB.
  
  The major win is disabling logging in ReleaseFast wasm builds (~200KB).
  
  The next is removing aggressive inlining in paths that don't make sense
  for performance. Verified with benchmarks on native to not affect
  anything really.
  
  The third was really dumb: `var buf: [4096]u32 = @splat(c)` in LLVM
  releasefast for wasm was lowering to 4096 separate `i32.store`...
  like... 30KB of code. Replacing this with a for loop reduced by 30KB and
  made REP (a rare sequence) 11x faster lol.

  This introduces a `-Dvt-features` build option for libghostty-vt that
  compiles out optional feature areas, primarily so size-conscious

  The flag is similar to `-Dcpu`, `+feature` or `feature` to enable it,

  Example: `-Dvt-features=-all,+render-state` builds only the render

  its not a problem unless an unavailable function is referenced at link

  ```text
  The software CRC32C fallback (WebAssembly and any other target without a

  profiled at ~65% of snapshot encode and ~70% of decode self-time in V8.
  Replace it with slicing-by-16: sixteen bytes fold per iteration through
  comptime per-position tables, so the serial dependency advances one block
  at a time instead of one byte.
  
  The hardware backends (aarch64 CRC, x86_64 SSE4.2) are unchanged, so
  native is expected to be unaffected; its deltas below are run-to-run
  noise.

  ```text
  When the record source already has the complete payload buffered — always
  the case for in-memory snapshots such as ghostty_snapshot_decoder_new_buf
  — the record reader now borrows the payload straight out of the source
  buffer instead of streaming it through the limited and hashing reader
  adapters. Payload decoders parse a fixed reader over the borrowed bytes,
  `finish` validates the CRC with a single bulk update, and the source
  advances only after validation.
  
  The page decoder takes a matching fast path: a fully buffered payload is
  parsed in place, skipping the staging allocation and copy it previously
  made per PAGE record. Streaming sources are unchanged.
  
  This is a modest win on its own; it is also the foundation for later
  commits whose buffered fast paths rely on the payload being contiguous.

  ```text
  Row encoding previously made two scalar passes over every row (a backward
  scan for the encoded cell count and a validation pass accumulating the
  width-selection OR), then wrote a 3-byte header and per-width chunked
  cells through separate writer calls.
  
  Three changes, all bulk-codec only with the portable path unchanged:
  
    - scanRow computes the count and word-OR in @Vector(4, u64) strides.
      Trailing default cells are all-zero words, so the OR over the whole
      row equals the OR over the encoded prefix.
    - The per-cell wide-pair validation loop is skipped entirely when the
      OR carries no wide bits, which is every row of plain text.
    - Rows are emitted with a single reservation in the destination's spare
      buffer capacity (header plus cells, no writer calls), using explicit
      i8x16.shuffle truncation for the 1/2/4-byte cell widths. Zig 0.16
      disables loop auto-vectorization, so the previous "vectorizable"
      truncating loop was actually scalar. Destinations without buffered
      capacity (counting writers, a still-growing scratch) fall through to
      the streaming path.

  ```text
  Grapheme suffix encoding made two full passes over the grid (a counting
  pass, then an emit pass) and issued three writer calls per entry plus one
  per codepoint. Every grapheme cell owns exactly one entry in the page's
  grapheme map, so the section count now comes straight from
  page.graphemeCount() with no counting pass, and entries are batched
  through a 4 KB buffer with one writer call per flush. The per-entry size
  check moved into the emit loop; an error still cancels the whole record
  before any of it is emitted, so error behavior is unchanged.
  
  Decoding similarly parsed entry headers and codepoints with one reader
  call per integer. Fully buffered payloads (the common case after the
  borrowed-payload commit) now parse entry headers and codepoint runs
  directly from the buffered bytes, and entries whose target cell cannot
  carry a suffix discard their codepoints in bulk.

  ```text
  Decoding one- and two-byte cells widened them to their 8-byte words one
  scalar store at a time. The bulk codec now widens sixteen transported
  bytes per step with byte shuffles against a zero vector, degrading
  width-two surrogate lanes to U+FFFD with a vector select, exactly
  matching the scalar path. Short row tails reprocess the final full
  window with overlapping stores that rewrite identical bytes.
  
  This is a native win: the shuffles lower to NEON and take ascii decode
  from 38.9 ms to 34.0 ms (measured by toggling this path at the tip of
  this series). On wasm, V8 runs the scalar fallback at the same speed as
  the shuffle version — the loop is store-bound either way — so the wasm
  deltas below are flat.
  
  Row decoding also drops per-field packed-struct read-modify-writes in
  favor of one load and one store per row header, and rows that are fully
  default (zero header byte, zero encoded cells) skip all work: decoded
  pages start zeroed, which is exactly the default row and cell state.

  ```text
  Cell decoding ran wide-pair normalization inline for every decoded cell:
  two neighbor loads and a switch per cell, even though the overwhelming
  majority of rows contain no wide cells at all. Normalization is defined
  against already-stored predecessors, so running it as an ordered pass
  over the stored row afterward is exactly equivalent to interleaving it.
  
  The word-cell decoders now accumulate the bitwise OR of the row's wire
  words as they apply cells, and the pass is gated on it: rows without
  wide bits are already normalized (every cell narrow), and width-four and
  narrower transports cannot encode wide bits at all, so their rows skip
  the check at comptime. That removes the per-cell neighbor traffic from
  all styled text, which decodes through the four-byte width.

  of plain scrollback. Empty tables now use a shared `.empty` remap that

  Pages that do declare entries are unchanged.
  
  (Leaving the entries array unzeroed behind a seen-bitmap-gated `get` was

  keeps its simple zero-means-unmapped representation.)

  ```text
  Style entries went through roughly five writer or reader vtable calls
  each: encode wrote three 4-byte colors and two u16s separately, and
  decode read 16 bytes into a stack buffer only to re-parse it through a
  nested fixed reader, one small read per field. Style-heavy pages carry
  hundreds of entries per page, so encode now assembles each entry in a
  16-byte buffer with a single write, and decode parses the fixed-size
  entry directly from a byte array. Entries additionally parse straight
  from the buffered payload (ID and value together) when it is contiguous.
  
  Inserting a decoded style also hashed twice: an explicit `lookup` before
  `add`, even though `add` already returns the existing entry for repeated
  values. Insert with `add` alone, taking one reference per accepted table
  entry, and surrender those references through the encoded-ID remap after
  grid decoding, the same scheme hyperlink entries already use. Refcount
  outcomes are identical: each distinct style nets its cell references.

  ```text
  Slicing tables removed the byte-at-a-time dependency chain, but each
  16-byte fold still depends serially on the previous one, leaving the
  software CRC latency-bound at roughly 2.5-3 GB/s in V8 while snapshot
  payloads run through it once per direction. wasm has no carry-less
  multiply, so wider tables are the only classic escape — and measuring
  slicing-by-32 against interleaving showed the extra 16 KB of tables buys
  nothing once the chain is hidden.
  
  Instead, inputs of 4 KiB and up split into thirds processed as three
  independent fold chains in one loop, then merge with the GF(2) zero-shift
  operator: crc(A ++ B, s) = crc(B, 0) XOR zeroShift(crc(A, s), |B|). The
  shift matrices are comptime, storing only even powers of two (an odd
  power applies the preceding matrix twice), 4 KB total. Software CRC
  throughput roughly doubles; hardware backends are untouched, so native
  is unaffected (tables below are noise).

  Snapshot encode is now 4-7x faster, decode is 3x faster for wasm builds.
  
  Snapshot decode is particularly important for wasm builds because
  libghostty is mainly used on web as a terminal _viewer_ and snapshots
  are the best, most efficient way to ship down full terminal state.
  
  The biggest change here is a totally custom software CRC32
  implementation, which accounted for ~70% of total decode time. Native
  builds on aarch64/x86_64 use dedicated hardware instructions that wasm
  doesn't have. We've written a custom CRC32 impl (verified against Zig

  Partially addresses #13796. Extends #13222.
  
  Previously, `insertText` commits without marked text were delivered via
  `sendText`, which applies paste semantics and wraps the text in
  bracketed
  paste when the program enables it. macOS dictation and other input
  methods often commit without marked text, so programs treated dictated
  text as a paste: opencode collapsed it into a `"[Pasted ~N lines]"` chip
  and Neovim applied paste-mode handling.
  
  `insertText` is only invoked by input methods (IME, dictation, emoji
  picker, character viewer); real paste operations use a separate path.
  Every non-empty commit is now sent as a key event — the same path
  already used for preedit commits since #13222 — so input method text
  always arrives as typed input.
  
  Typing is unaffected (the accumulator path returns earlier) and Cmd+V
  pastes are unaffected. `committedPreeditTextAction` is renamed to
  `committedTextAction` since it no longer only handles preedit commits.
  
  Testing:
  
  - 311 macOS unit tests pass.
  - Manually verified on macOS 26: dictation into Opencode and Neovim
    arrives inline with no paste handling; emoji picker inserts inline;
    Chinese IME composition unchanged; dictation in Neovim normal mode now
    behaves as keystrokes, matching Terminal.app.
  
  Notes:
  
  - Dictated "new line" now matches Terminal.app behavior (no newline
    with typed-text semantics). The previous behavior came from the paste
    path preserving the newline; a follow-up could deliver it as an
    Enter keypress if desired.

  ````text
  This PR makes `ghostty_type_json` contain more metadata necessary for
  FFI without access to the C header to produce safe, ABI compliant field
  access.
  
  The existing `ghostty_type_json` didn't expose enough information:
  embedders still had to hardcode enum values, tagged union values, and
  packed bit layouts. For wasm this meant copying offsets and masks from
  Zig internals and hoping they didn't drift. This isn't an ABI I want to
  promise.
  
  This also includes a formal JSON schema included in Doxygen docs and
  used in CI to continuously validate our output structure. I'd like to
  expand in the future comparing to actual C headers too.

    - `zig build -Demit-lib-vt -Dtarget=x86_64-linux-gnu`
    - `zig build`
    - Verified the regression test fails without the release guard
  - Manually tested the GTK backend under Wayland/Sway and X11/XWayland,
  with the GTK simple input context and ibus 1.5.34:
      - Ergo-L `!` and `'`
      - Spanish `[`, `{`, `]`, and `}`
  - Presses, repeats, and both modifier-release orders in `nvim --clean`
      - Dead-key composition and cancellation
      - Unicode hexadecimal input
  - Full kitty keyboard mode with `kitty +kitten show_key -m kitty`,
  including composed text

  ```text
  Zig default's Wasm stacks to 1MB. Change it to 128 KB instead.
  
  This removes 896 KiB from every Wasm instance's initial linear memory
  reservation. That means that simply _loading_ `ghostty-vt.wasm` is down
  this much.
  
  Through various workload benchmarks of real terminal snapshots,
  artificial worst case full ascii, full styled, full emoji, full mixed,
  etc. workloads, I wasn't able to get a stack to go above 17 KB, so 128 KB
  is VERY generous. Lets start here.

  ```text
  A custom memory pool for Wasm that grows by exactly one item size per
  growth and shares the pool across the entire Wasm-module instead of
  per-terminal.
  
  Some background on why `std.heap.MemoryPool` is considered harmful for
  WebAssembly:
  
  First, the std.heap.MemoryPool grows 1.5x at each growth point. The backing
  allocator for that is usually a GPA which is the BrkAllocator for wasm.
  This grows by power-of-two big-allocation slots. If you pair these together
  you get a massive permanent linear memory growth. On non-wasm targets,
  this doesn't matter because these are virtual memory mappings that don't
  cost physical memory, but wasm doesn't work that way.
  
  Second, we were using one pool per terminal. On wasm, this meant that
  we paid for the free list N times. On non-wasm, this makes sense because
  the synchronization overhead has so far been measurable enough under
  load to be prohibitive (although, I'm still skeptical about this and want
  to look into it). On wasm, we build single-threaded modules, so we can use
  a global free list without any extra overhead.
  
  ## Benchmarks
  
  80x24 terminal with 1000-line scrollack processing 16MB of plain ASCII.
  
  | Scenario                        |    Before |     After |
  | ------------------------------- | --------: | --------: |
  | Fresh instance                  |  0.56 MiB |  0.56 MiB |
  | First `terminal_new` (delta)    | +3.44 MiB | +0.88 MiB |
  | One filled terminal (total)     |  4.00 MiB |  1.88 MiB |
  | Each additional filled terminal | +3.00 MiB | +0.44 MiB |
  | 5 filled terminals (total)      | 16.00 MiB |  4.06 MiB |
  
  Throughput numbers are unchanged on wasm and native (to be expected in
  the latter because this is all gated on wasm).

  On non-wasm targets, the memory growth doesn't matter because these are

  large virtual memory chunks and avoid them. Again, wasm doesn't work
  this way.

  Note I'm still very much optimizing the above numbers! This is just my
  first big win.

  ```text
  ## Summary
  
  - Prevent desktop notification title and body truncation from producing
  invalid UTF-8.
  - Truncate fixed-size buffers to the longest valid UTF-8 prefix.
  - Add regression tests for multibyte characters at the buffer boundary.
  
  Fixes #13795
  
  ## Testing
  
  - Confirmed the original reproducer produces `[Invalid UTF-8]` with the
  installed Ghostty.
  - Confirmed the patched Ghostty displays a valid, truncated
  notification.
  - Added tests covering both notification title and body truncation.
  
  ## AI Usage Disclosure
  
  I used OpenAI Codex to investigate the root cause, implement the fix and
  regression tests, run validation, and help prepare the issue and PR
  descriptions. I reviewed and understand the submitted change.

  ```text
  The GhosttyWriter adapter was unbuffered, so for streaming writers that
  make small writes like the formatter, it produces a crazy amount of callbacks:
  one styled HTML page invoked the callback ~50,000 times in a benchmark lol.
  
  Change WriterAdapter to have an optional buffer (initBuffered) and use
  a 4 KB buffer for all current callers. Also optimize single byte splats
  to use memset.
  
  Results: that same styled HTML example goes from ~50K callbacks to 124.
  And throughput through the C API also improved across every workload
  I tested (styled and unstyled text in every format).

  then report updated geometry after later resizes. The native termio
  stream already queues the initial report, but the terminal stream only
  reported from `resize`, so libghostty consumers that enabled the mode
  after committing geometry received nothing until another resize.
  
  This makes the generic handler match termio by requesting current
  geometry through the existing size callback and writing the encoded
  report through `write_pty` on every enable.

  ```text
  Supersedes #13886
  
  This fixes an incompatibility between Ghostty and Kitty 0.47.1+.
  
  Previously, Ghostty handled `C=0` by moving down at most one terminal
  height and then clamping the horizontal destination to the screen. The
  limit protected against an image command requesting billions of rows,
  but it counted ordinary movement to the bottom as well as scrolling.
  
  Kitty defines `C=0` as leaving the cursor after the image and implements
  the movement as rows minus one, plus one row when the image reaches the
  right edge:

  (Had to view Kitty source to verify what the spec meant)
  
  For example, an eight-row, full-width image in a five-row terminal needs
  four moves to reach the bottom and four more to scroll. The old limit
  allowed only five moves in total, so the next image started four rows
  inside the first one. Clamping the horizontal destination also left the
  cursor at the final column instead of wrapping to column one of the next
  row. Consecutive images could therefore overlap in both directions.

  **Reverted https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/13664 with a
  second thought.**
  
  This keeps the consistency with other first-party apps like Terminal,
  Finder, and Music. It seems that most of the first-party apps show the
  standard icons on macOS 27 for "Settings...", "Find", "AutoFill" and
  etc., but in a separate group.

  ```text
  Text binding actions previously allocated a temporary buffer for every

  continue to use the existing heap-backed behavior.
